# Coin-Game
How many coins can you get?
Collect as many coins as you can in this typing game, and see if you can get the best pet!
Good luck!


notes:
the 'p' or 'pets' command is not working as well as wanted
the 'a' or 'active' command has been made but is slightly faulty: it sometimes duplicates pets in the game, giving you an unintended advantage. The problem might be to do with the new 'e' or 'equipt'command, as it is also fairly new.

**********************************
older notes
currently the 'e' or 'equip' command is only working for any pet of class Wasp_object
